	- show storyboard (on webpage)
	- Idea: Are the Saints unlucky?
		- Game 1: Minnesota Miracle
			- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJzpoj_NxqQ 
			- comparing Defenses for season compared to that game?

		- Game 2: No Call against Rams?
			- Comparing refereeing
			- 
		- Game 3: Vikings 
			- about Drew Brees Injury
			- comparison pre-injury vs post-injury
			- Main Idea: did the injury hurt Brees?
				- compare the offensive line, because Brees fumbled it.

			- idea: make it interactive:
				- you can toggle on/off Brees

	- Other idea:
		- Then in playoffs vs in regular season

- Introduction:
	- https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1443743-ranking-the-nfls-5-luckiest-and-unluckiest-teams#slide8
	- explain how the Saints are considered unlucky (by the stats)
	- give the examples of how they have fallen short in the last 3 years.

1 big pop-up:
	- website says Saints are unlucky
	- Mariam talks about being a Saints Fan


So, what are trying to say:
	- Game 1:
		- for the Minnesota Game, we want to show how good the secondary was for the Vikings
		- Show how Marcus Williams was during the season (to show if his error was expected)
			- Radial Graph of how the secondary/team performed compared to usual.
			- dot chart of how the secondary performed

	- Game 2 vs Rams:
		- the no-call from the referee
		- done by Mariam

	- Game 3:
		- loss to the Vikings
		- this is attributed to the Drew Brees Injury
			- so we can show how the 
			- double bar chart



Plan:

	- Wednesday:
		- get data
		- get graphs
		- have a few explaining sentences
		- @ noon: finish layout

	- Work on it separate (Wednesday Week 10 to Wednesday Finals)

	- Wednesday (Finals Week):
		- work on anything else

		
Game 2:
	- goal: comparing the refereeing between that game compared to other games
	- comparing the performance of the Saints compared to the regular season.

Game 3:
	- goal: comparing the performance of the Saints pre-Brees injury and during the game.
